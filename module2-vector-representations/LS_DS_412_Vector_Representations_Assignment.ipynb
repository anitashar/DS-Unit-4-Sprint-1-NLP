    "\n",
    " - Try different visualizations for words and frequencies - what story do you want to tell with the data?\n",
    " - Scrape Job Listings for the job title \"Data Analyst\". How do these differ from Data Scientist Job Listings\n",
    " - Try and identify requirements for experience specific technologies that are asked for in the job listings. How are those distributed among the job listings?\n",
    " - Use a clustering algorithm to cluster documents by their most important terms. Do the clusters reveal any common themes?\n",
    "  - **Hint:** K-means might not be the best algorithm for this. Do a little bit of research to see what might be good for this. Also, remember that algorithms that depend on Euclidean distance break down with high dimensional data.\n",
    " - Create a labeled dataset - which jobs will you apply for? Train a model to select the jobs you are most likely to apply for. :) "
